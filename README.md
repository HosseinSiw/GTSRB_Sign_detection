### German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark

GTSRB stands for the "German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark." It is a dataset and benchmark widely used in the field of computer vision and machine learning for evaluating algorithms related to traffic sign recognition. The dataset contains thousands of images of traffic signs captured under various conditions, such as different lighting, weather, and camera angles.
